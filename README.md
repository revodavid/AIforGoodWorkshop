## About these notebooks

This library includes three notebooks to support the workshop:

1. The AI behind Seeing AI. Use the web-interfaces to Cognitive Services to learn about the AI services behind the "Seeing AI" app
2. Computer Vision API with R. Use an R script to interact with the Computer Vision API and generate captions for random Wikimedia images.
3. Custom Vision with R. An R function to classify an image as a "Hot Dog" or "Not Hot Dog", using the Custom Vision service.

These notebooks are hosted on Azure Notebooks at https://notebooks.azure.com/davidsmi/libraries/aiforgood?WT.mc_id=opensource-0000-davidsmi, where you can run them interactively. You can also download them to run them using Jupyter.
